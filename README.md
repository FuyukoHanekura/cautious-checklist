# cautious-checklist

An **open-source, offline-first task manager** that syncs with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Obsidian, and Notion.

Designed to be **self-hostable**, extensible, and free from paywalls.

## Vision
Create a complete open-source task app that:
- Works offline, syncs across devices.
- Integrates with major calendars and note-taking tools.
- Stays 100% free and open via AGPLv3 (code) and CC BY-SA 4.0 (assets/docs).

## MVP Goals
- Cross-platform app (desktop & mobile).
- Local-first task storage.
- Two-way Google Calendar sync.
- Simple conflict resolution ("latest update wins").

## Roadmap
See [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for full development plan.
